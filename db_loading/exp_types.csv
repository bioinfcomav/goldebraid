experiment_types	SE_001	Plant material: 5-6 weeks old Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Recommended growth conditions: 24ºC/20ºC 16h light/8h darkness. Constructs: Your test construct must include the Luc gene under the regulation of the promoter/teminator under study, together with the 35S:Renilla:Tnos transcriptional unit in cis. Construct GB1116 must be infiltrated in parallel as standard reference for promoter activity. All tested GBelements must be co-infiltrated with the silencing supressor P19 (GB1203), either in cis or in trans. Sampling and analysis: infiltrated leaves are collected 3 d.p.i. (days post infiltration). Preferably 3 leaf discs (0.8 cm in diameter, approximately 18-19mg) from 3 independent leaves should be assayed. Discs are transferred to a multiwell plate where a chemical inducer can or cannot be present, and kept under the same light conditions used to grow the plants. Samples to measure the Fluc/Rluc ratios are taken at different times. All data must be expressed as RPU (relative promoter units) relative to the reference standard GB1116. We recommend the use of the Dual-Glo© Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
experiment_types	SE_002	Plant material: 5-6 weeks old Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Recommended growth conditions: 24ºC/20ºC 16h light/8h darkness.

experiment_types	SE_003	Plant material: Not defined. Recommended growth conditions: Not defined. Constructs: Not defined. Analysis: Calculate the transformation efficiency by dividing the number of obtained transgenic plants between the number of inoculated explants.
experiment_types	SE_004	Plant material: 6-7 weeks old Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Recommended growth conditions: 24ºC/20ºC 16h light/8h darkness. Constructs: Not defined. Sampling and analysis: Extract your protein, purify it and determine the amount of recombinant protein relative to the total amount of protein or weight of plant tissue.
experiment_types	SE_005	Plant material: Not defined. Recommended growth conditions: Not defined. Constructs: Your test constructs must include a Cas gene together with one or more short guide RNAs (sgRNA). Sampling and analysis: Determine the efficiency of the Cas/sgRNA construct by calculating the percentage of mutated genomic DNA (for transient expression) or the number of plants showing mutations in reference to the total number of transgenic plants (for stable transformation).
