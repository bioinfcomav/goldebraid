experiment_types	SE_001	Agroinfiltrate leaves of 5-6 weeks old Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Measurements are normalized to the Fluc/Rluc ratio of GB1116. The tested GBelement should be coinfiltrated with P19 (GB1203), either in cis or en trans. Preferably three discs from independent leaves should be assayed. The cut discs of 3dpi plants (d=0.8cm, approximately 18-19mg) are transferred to a plate where a chemical inducer can or cannot be present. Samples to measure the Fluc/Rluc ratios are taken at different times. The plants growth conditions are 24°C (light)/20°C (darkness) under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod. Leaf discs are maintained on the same luminosity conditions. We recommend the use of the Dual-Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
experiment_types	SE_002	Agroinfiltrate leaves of 5-6 weeks old Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Measurements have to be normalized to the Fluc/Rluc ratio of GB1116. Your GBelement should be coinfiltrated with P19 (GB1203), either in cis or en trans. Cut leaf discs (d=0.8cm, approximately 18-19mg) from leaves to analyze. Preferably three discs from independent leaves should be assayed. The plants should be grown at 24°C (light)/20°C (darkness) under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod. Leaf discs should be maintained on the same luminosity conditions. We recommend to use the Dual-Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
